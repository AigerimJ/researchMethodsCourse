    title = {Gigahertz decoy quantum key distribution with 1 Mbit/s secure key rate},
    volume = {16},
    journal = {Optics express},
    
    abstract = "We report the first gigahertz clocked decoy-protocol quantum key distribution (QKD). Record key rates have been achieved thanks to the use of self-differencing InGaAs avalanche photodiodes designed specifically for high speed single photon detection. The system is characterized with a secure key rate of 1.02 Mbit/s for a fiber distance of 20 km and 10.1 kbit/s for 100 km. As the present advance relies upon compact non-cryogenic detectors, it opens the door towards practical and low cost QKD systems to secure broadband communication in future.",
    
     annote = {In this article authors have demonstrated high key rate QKD with gigahertz-clocked InGaAs APDs using the decoy protocol, which generates keys with unconditional security. A significant leap in the secure key rate has been obtained, through high performance SD detectors and the effectiveness of the decoy protocol. With this advance, QKD is now practical for realizing high bandwidth information-theoretic secure communication. Researchers claim that this is not only an exciting advance for cryptography, but also for the maturing field of quantum information science.},
    
    note = {This paper was interesting to observe, however it rather physics approach, than computer science. Also, quantum key distribution concept was well-described.},

    abstract="We introduce a problem of distinguishing between two quantum states as a new underlying problem to build a computational cryptographic scheme that is ''secure'' against quantum adversary. Our problem is a natural generalization of the distinguishability problem between two probability distributions, which are commonly used in computational cryptography. More precisely, our problem QSCDffis the computational distinguishability problem between two types of random coset states with a hidden permutation over the symmetric group. We show that (i) QSCDffhas the trapdoor property; (ii) the average-case hardness of QSCDffcoincides with its worst-case hardness; and (iii) QSCDffis at least as hard in the worst case as the graph automorphism problem. Moreover, we show that QSCDffcannot be efficiently solved by any quantum algorithm that naturally extends Shor's factorization algorithm. These cryptographic properties of QSCDffenable us to construct a public-key cryptosystem, which is likely to withstand any attack of a polynomial-time quantum adversary.",
    
    
     annote = {Authors claim that the computational distinction problem QSCDﬀ has useful properties to design a quantum PKC whose security is guaranteed by the computational intractability of GA. Although GA is reducible to QSCDﬀ, there seems a large gap between the hardness of GA and that of QSCDﬀ because all the combinatorial structures of input graphs in GA are completely lost in QSCDﬀ. It is, therefore, pressing to ﬁnd a nice classical problem which almost matches the computational hardness of QSCDﬀ. Since no fast quantum algorithm is known for QSCDﬀ, discovering such an algorithm may require new tools and novel proof techniques in quantum complexity theory. Researchers claim that it is imperative to search for other simple quantum states whose computational indistinguishability is helpful to construct a more secure cryptosystem. Similar to QSCDﬀ, QSCDcyc owns useful cryptographic properties for which we have built a multibit quantum PKC. If one proves that the worst-case hardness of QSCDcyc is lower-bounded by, for instance, the hardness of GA, then our multi-bit quantum PKC might ﬁnd more practical use.},

We show that oblivious transfer and bit commitment can be implemented in this model using protocols where honest parties need no quantum memory, whereas an adversarial player needs quantum memory of size at least n/2 in order to break the protocol, where n is the number of qubits transmitted. This is in sharp contrast to the classical bounded-memory model, where we can only tolerate adversaries with the memory of size quadratic in honest players’ memory size. Our protocols are efficient, non-interactive and can be implemented using today’s technology. On the technical side, a new entropic uncertainty relation involving min-entropy is established.},

Moreover, these protocols are non-interactive and can be implemented using today’s technology.

It is also proved that zero-knowledge proofs for every language in NP exist that are secure against quantum attacks, assuming the existence of quantum computationally concealing commitment schemes. Previously no non-trivial proof systems were known to be zero-knowledge against quantum attacks, except in restricted settings such as the honest-verifier and common reference string models.
